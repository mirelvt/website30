        <blog_descr>There are a lot of libraries around to create svg and svg animations like Greensock, Raphael, SnapSVG, SVG.js. In my case I want to see how far you get with basic browser support.

        <blog_descr>Since 2013 I'm using SublimeText editor and wrote an how to about it to get you up and running. Now 5 years later I'm still using it.

In this post I'll explain what packages I need for my environment and why I still like SublimeText over Atom or VSCode.</blog_descr>

        <blog_descr>In my former blog post I wrote an <a href="/blog/make-taskrunner">introduction how to

    <blog_item date="March 15, 2017" url="make-taskrunner.html">
        <blog_title>GNU Make for running tasks</blog_title>
        <blog_descr>Every front end developer have heard of or is using one of the task runners like Grunt, Gulp, Broccoli. There are a lot of articles and how to's on the web about these tools. However, there is one that doesn't get a lot of attention and that is GNU Make. It was originally created by Stuart Feldman in April 1976. GNU Make is not really popular among front end developers, it has a steep learning curve in comparison with Grunt or Gulp and there are not much examples on how to use it for front end development. In this blog post I would like to change that, I will show you how you can use GNU Make as a task runner for front end development.</blog_descr>
